# Controls (VR Offices)

This document lists the current keyboard/mouse bindings in `vr_offices/`.

## Camera (when dialogue is closed)

- Orbit: **Right Mouse** drag
- Pan: **Middle Mouse** drag
- Zoom: **Mouse Wheel**

## NPC interaction (when dialogue is closed)

- Select NPC: **Left Click** on an NPC
- Talk: **Double Left Click** on an NPC (same as pressing **E**)
- Talk (keyboard): select an NPC, press **E**

## Dialogue overlay (when dialogue is open)

- Exit dialogue (keyboard): press **Esc twice**
  - 1st Esc: stop typing (release input focus)
  - 2nd Esc: close the dialogue overlay
- Exit dialogue (mouse, click outside the panel on the dark backdrop):
  - **Right Click** once, or
  - **Double Left Click**

Input notes:

- While the dialogue overlay is open, mouse interactions are captured by the UI so the 3D camera won’t orbit/zoom/pan.
