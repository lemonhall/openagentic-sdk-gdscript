# v26 — Desk IRC Verification UX

## Vision (this version)

In VR Offices, the player can verify a desk’s IRC connectivity *in-world*:

- Double-click a desk/computer to open the IRC overlay focused on that desk.
- The overlay shows the desk’s derived channel, status, readiness, and recent IRC lines.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Scope | DoD | Verify | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Desk pick collider | Desk instances are ray-pickable without affecting physics | `tests/projects/vr_offices/test_vr_offices_desk_pick_collider.gd` | todo |
| M2 | Double-click desk opens overlay | Double-click desk opens IRC overlay on Desks tab with that desk selected | Manual in-game check | todo |
