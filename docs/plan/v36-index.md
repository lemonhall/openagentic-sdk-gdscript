# v36 — IRC Desks: Copy Diagnostics + Visual Divider

## Vision (this version)

- Desk “identity diagnostics” (desk/ws/channel/status/ready/log path) are copyable with one click.
- The Desks details panel has a clear visual separation between identity info and raw IRC log output.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Scope | DoD | Verify | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Copy diagnostics | Desks panel has a Copy button that copies the top diagnostics text | `tests/test_vr_offices_irc_overlay_desks_copy_smoke.gd` | todo |
| M2 | Divider | Desks panel has a visible divider between diagnostics and log | `tests/test_vr_offices_irc_overlay_desks_copy_smoke.gd` | todo |
